# YearLength
## How long is a year? Measuring the length of 2020 with the Twitter API.
This project aims to use Twitter analysis to compare the media cycle in 2020 to an average year. Only the past 5 years will be considered in the "average" to minimise the bias introduced by changed usage of Twitter over time. Comparison will be done through the use of "blockbuster headlines", a term to be defined through the public metrics of tweets by major news sites such as the BBC, CNN, and Bloomberg. These public metrics are the number of likes, comments, and retweets received by each tweet. 
\n\n
Once defined, the number of tweets satisfying the "blockbuster headline" criteria will be evaluated for 2015-2020. It is expected that this number will be substantially higher for 2020 than other years, however it is possible that media fatigue will have led to stories which would have attracted more attention in other years receiving less attention than expected. In this case, it may be necessary to carry out some normalisation by comparing similar headlines over time. For example, headlines relating to the 2020 American Presidential election can be compared to similar stories for 2016.

This is a casual project, however if successful the results may be submitted for consideration in a popular science magazine or newspaper.
